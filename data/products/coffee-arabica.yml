body: Coffea arabica, also known as the Arabian coffee, "coffee shrub of
  Arabia", "mountain coffee", or "arabica coffee", is a species of Coffea. It is
  believed to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated, and is the
  dominant cultivar, representing some 60% of global production. Coffee produced
  from the less acidic, more bitter, and more highly caffeinated robusta bean
  makes up the preponderance of the balance.
